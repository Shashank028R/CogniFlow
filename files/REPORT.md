## 1. One-Paragraph Pitch (Executive Summary)

> "CogniFlow is a full-stack real-time chat platform built on the MERN stack with Socket.IO for WebSockets and Google's Gemini API for an embedded AI assistant. It supports one-on-one and group messaging, WhatsApp-style read receipts, image/file sharing via Cloudinary, and a native bot — CogniBot — that participates directly in conversations, including understanding images sent to it. I built it to practice real-time system design, not just CRUD APIs: handling presence, delivery guarantees, and concurrent socket connections properly is a different problem than a typical REST app."

## 2. Tech Stack — What & Why

| Layer | Choice | Version | Why this choice (talking points) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Frontend Framework** | React | `^19.2.5` | Component reuse, modern hooks for declarative state, latest React 19 concurrent features. |
| **Build Tool** | Vite | `^8.0.10` | ESM-native dev server with instant HMR and optimized production bundling. |
| **Styling** | TailwindCSS | `^4.2.4` | Utility-first design tokens with seamless dark/light mode, clean enterprise SaaS typography, and crisp border elevation. |
| **Real-Time Transport**| Socket.IO | `^4.8.3` | Handles WebSocket fallback (long-polling), built-in room clustering (`socket.join`), and auto-reconnection. |
| **Backend Framework** | Express | `^5.2.1` | Minimal, robust, middleware pipeline; native support for modern asynchronous routing. |
| **Database & ODM** | MongoDB + Mongoose | `^9.6.1` | Chat data is naturally document-shaped (messages, rooms with embedded members & receipts); avoids heavy multi-table SQL joins. |
| **AI Engine** | Google Generative AI | `^0.24.1` | Native multimodal capability (Gemma / Gemini) accepting text prompts + Base64 image payloads in a single turn. |
| **File Storage** | Cloudinary | `^1.41.3` | Automated media transformation, CDN URL delivery, and zero server disk bloat. |
| **Authentication** | JWT + Bcrypt | `^9.0.3` / `^6.0.0` | Stateless token authentication with adaptive salt rounds for secure password storage. |
| **Email Service** | Nodemailer | `^8.0.7` | Transactional email dispatch for 6-digit registration OTP codes via SMTP. |

### Architectural Defense: "Why MongoDB over PostgreSQL?"
Chat applications operate primarily on document-centric models: a message belongs to a single room, has dynamic arrays of member deliveries/reads, and conversation histories are append-heavy. Relational modeling requires join tables (`message_deliveries`, `message_reads`, `room_members`) for operations that fit cleanly as embedded sub-documents in MongoDB. The trade-off is eventual consistency over strict multi-document ACID transactions, which aligns with modern chat UX requirements.

### 3.2 Dual Communication Channels: REST vs. WebSockets

- **REST (HTTP)**: Used for discrete, idempotent, or stateless operations — authentication, fetching paginated chat history, updating profiles, and uploading files via multipart form data.
- **WebSockets (Socket.IO)**: Used for event-driven server pushes where low latency is critical — new message broadcasting, real-time typing indicators, read receipts, and live user presence.

> **Rule of thumb**: *If the client initiates a data query, use REST; if the server notifies the client of an unprompted state change, emit a WebSocket event.*

## 4. Deep Dive: Core Subsystems

### 4.1 Real-Time Messaging & Socket Pipeline

- **Room Join Semantics**: Socket.IO's `socket.join(roomId)` partitions sockets into rooms so `io.to(roomId).emit(...)` delivers messages to active participants without manual socket-to-room book-keeping.
- **WhatsApp-Style Read Receipts**:
  1. **Sent ($\checkmark$)**: Message document created in MongoDB.
  2. **Delivered ($\checkmark\checkmark$ gray)**: Emitted via `mark delivered` event; recipient's client adds its ID to `deliveredTo` in MongoDB.
  3. **Read ($\checkmark\checkmark$ blue/cyan)**: Emitted via `mark read` event; recipient's client adds its ID to `readBy` upon message viewport intersection.
- **Ephemeral Typing Indicators**: Emitted as lightweight socket events (`typing` / `stop typing`) without database persistence, keeping write throughput clean.
- **Chat Clearing**: Per-user soft clearing implemented via `clearedHistory: [{ user, timestamp }]` on the `Room` model. Fetching messages filters out messages older than the user's clear timestamp without deleting messages for other members.

### 4.2 CogniBot — Embedded Multimodal AI Subsystem

- **Bot as a First-Class User**: CogniBot is provisioned on server boot (`initCogniBot.js`) with an explicit ObjectId, username `"CogniBot"`, and email `"cognibot@cogniflow.ai"`. This architectural decision means the bot shares the same room models, schemas, and message pipelines as human users with zero bespoke schema branching.
- **Trigger Heuristics**:
  - **1-on-1 Chat**: Any message sent in a room where one member is `global.cogniBotId` automatically dispatches to the AI.
  - **Group Chat**: Requires explicit `@cogni` tag to prevent excessive AI chatter and token consumption.
- **Multimodal Image Analysis**:
  ```
  User uploads image → Cloudinary returns CDN URL → Backend downloads image
  → Converts to Base64 inlineData → Sends to Gemini alongside conversation context
  → AI responds with structured <response>...</response> output.
  ```
- **Live Typing Feedback**: The backend emits `typing` to the room during Gemini inference and `stop typing` upon response creation.

### 4.3 Storage & File Handling Pipeline

- **Images**: Parsed by Multer, uploaded to Cloudinary folder `cogniflow`, and the local temporary file is removed immediately with `fs.unlinkSync`.
- **Documents & PDFs**: Stored in `/uploads` on the server and served statically via Express.

### 4.4 Authentication & Security Pipeline

- **Registration**: Password hashed using `bcrypt` (10 salt rounds). Generates a cryptographically random 6-digit numeric OTP (`crypto.randomInt(100000, 999999)`), stored in a dedicated `OTP` collection.
- **Email Dispatch**: HTML OTP sent to the user via Nodemailer.
- **Verification**: OTP checked; on success, a verified `User` record is created.
- **Session Tokens**: JWT signed with 30-day expiration and validated on protected endpoints via `authMiddleware.js`.

    User ||--o{ Room : "member of"
    User ||--o{ Message : "sends"
    Room ||--o{ Message : "contains"
    User ||--o{ OTP : "verifies with"

        Date updatedAt
    }

    Room {
        ObjectId _id
        String name
        Boolean isGroupChat
        String profilePic
        ObjectId admin
        ObjectId[] members
        ObjectId lastMessage
        Object[] documents
        Object[] clearedHistory
        Map unreadCounts

    }

    Message {
        ObjectId _id
        ObjectId sender
        ObjectId room
        String content
        String messageType
        String fileUrl
        String filePublicId
        Boolean isAiResponse
        Boolean isEdited
        Boolean isDeleted
        ObjectId[] deletedFor
        ObjectId[] deliveredTo
        ObjectId[] readBy
        Date createdAt
        Date updatedAt
    }

    OTP {
        ObjectId _id
        String email
        String otp
        String username
        String password
        Date createdAt
    }
```

### High-Value Indexes
- `Room`: `{ members: 1 }` index optimizes room listing queries for any user.
- `User`: `{ email: 1 }` and `{ username: 1 }` unique indexes prevent duplicate accounts.
- `Message`: Implicit index on `_id` and room-based sorting for chat history pagination.

## 7. Trade-offs & Engineering Decisions

| Decision | Trade-Off Made | Production Reality / Alternative |
|---|---|---|
| **MongoDB over PostgreSQL** | Flexible document modeling vs. weaker cross-collection transactional integrity | Appropriate for append-heavy chat; SQL would need multiple join tables for receipts. |
| **Stateless JWTs** | Easy horizontal scaling vs. cannot instantly revoke compromised tokens | Can be hardened with short-lived access tokens + refresh tokens stored in Redis. |
| **Embedded Receipts Array** | O(1) read performance when loading messages vs. array unbounded growth | Scales well for 2-50 member chats; large channels (10,000+) require receipt aggregation. |
| **Bot as a User Document** | Uniform schema reuse across all chat features vs. conceptual code-as-user entity | Drastically simplifies frontend and backend room logic. |
| **Local Disk for Documents** | Fast initial implementation vs. loss of files on ephemeral cloud restarts | Migrating non-image files to Cloudinary `resource_type: "raw"` solves persistence. |
| **JWT in localStorage** | Zero-friction client implementation vs. vulnerability to XSS | Standard hardening path: move to `httpOnly` secure cookies. |

## 9. Anticipated Interview Questions & Model Answers

### Q1: "Walk me through what happens when a user sends a message."
> "When a user types a message and clicks send, the React client executes `POST /api/messages` with the room ID, content, and optional attachment details. The Express `sendMessage` controller validates room membership and creates a `Message` document in MongoDB, incrementing unread counters on the room. If the chat is a 1-on-1 with CogniBot or mentions `@cogni`, an asynchronous task feeds recent chat context and any image attachment to Gemini, which streams back or generates an AI response. Simultaneously, the server emits `new message` over Socket.IO to all room members. As other clients receive and scroll to the message, they emit `mark delivered` and `mark read`, transitioning the checkmark from single gray to double gray to double cyan."

### Q2: "How would you scale this system to 100,000 concurrent connections?"
> "A single Node.js instance tops out around 10,000 to 20,000 concurrent sockets depending on message frequency. To scale:
> 1. **Socket.IO Redis Adapter**: Distribute socket connections across multiple Node instances behind an NGINX load balancer with sticky sessions, using Redis Pub/Sub to cross-broadcast messages.
> 2. **AI Task Queue**: Offload Gemini AI calls to a BullMQ worker queue to isolate external API latency and manage API rate-limiting cleanly.
> 3. **Database Sharding & Caching**: Shard MongoDB messages by `roomId` and cache recent room histories in Redis."

## 10. Live Operational Health Verification

Both services have been executed and verified in this environment:
- **Backend Server (`node index.js`)**: Listening on `http://localhost:3000`, connected to MongoDB Atlas, CogniBot initialized.
- **Frontend Client (`npm run dev`)**: Listening on `http://localhost:5173`, Vite bundled dependencies and served App shell.
